MiuHub is a simple Java-based music streaming platform management system. Motivation 
for this project comes from the lack of simplicity in the current apps on the market for music 
streaming purposes. This platform gives artists the ability to add songs to their accounts and 
allows listeners to listen to songs after they purchase packages from their accounts. The 
system gives administrators access to administrative features to manage both artist and 
listener accounts on the platform. 
Project has 8 classes. They are, 
1. Main Class 
2.  Listener Class 
3.  Artist Class 
4.  Admin Class 
5.  Song Class 
6.  Package Class 
7.  Payment Class 
8.  Report Class 
 
Main class is where the program starts and get user input to direct user into Listener, Artist or 
Admin classes. Song class, Package class, Payment class and Report class are abstract classes 
and they are accessed through the Listener, Artist and Admin classes. Each class have its own 
attributes and methods.
